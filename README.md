### Objectives
1. Establish and ensure high quality and consistency in the aesthetics of CSP products
2. Establish data visualization standards and guidelines
3. Improve efficiencies in implementing data visualization standards
4. Make aesthetics resources available and user-friendly to all CSPers

### CSP's visualization strategy
Generally speaking, our strategy with respect to visualizing ecological patterns
and processes involves capturing data or results in compelling colors with
minimal contextual information for simplicity.

### Approach
## Establish and ensure high quality and consistency in the aesthetics of CSP products
1. Identify focus/areas of need with respect to developing and/or improving aesthetics.(i.e., which templates need improvement?, is our color palette sufficient?, what are the inconsistencies in CSP products that need improvement?)
2. Experiment with the look and feel of CSP products â€“ this may involve refining and/or expanding upon elements of the existing aesthetic (i.e., logo, colors) or experimenting with entirely new aesthetics.
3. Develop/refine report, presentation, and map templates.

## Establish data visualization standards and guidelines
1. Establish standards and guidelines for color ramp stretches based on data distributions and develop go-to reference that explains rationale for different stretches
2. Establish standards and guidelines for use of color palettes based on character of the data (e.g., sequential vs. divergent)

## Improve efficiencies in implementing data visualization standards
1. Develop directory with snippets of code for color ramps (e.g., viridis, colorbrewer) formatted for different programming languages (i.e., Python, R, Java).
2. Develop directory with snippets of code for inserting CSP watermarks, logos, etc. into maps.

## Make aesthetics resources available and user-friendly to all CSPers
1. Develop (and/or further build out) online directories of aesthetics resources (i.e., templates, fonts, logos, and data visualization code snippets)
